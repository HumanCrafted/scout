  - **Devices**: Multiple icons (memory, wifi, solar-panel) with light background
  - **Assets**: Multiple icons (build, lan, warning, power) with light background
- Drag-and-drop placement from sidebar toolbar
- **Advanced marker management**:
  - Professional edit dialog with name and GPS coordinate fields
  - Lock/unlock functionality to prevent accidental marker movement
  - Delete functionality with confirmation
  - Compact control buttons to save sidebar space
- Draggable markers on map for repositioning (when unlocked)
- **Hierarchical grouping**: Drag markers in sidebar to create parent-child relationships
- Drag-off functionality to remove markers from groups
- Visual hierarchy with left borders for grouped markers

### üé® User Interface
- **Left sidebar**: Start New Map button, search box, map title editor, and placed markers list
- **Right sidebar**: Draggable marker toolbar (95px width)
- **Bottom controls**: Zoom display, map style toggle, labels toggle, re-center button
- Material Design icons (16px for markers, 12px for controls) for compact, intuitive controls
- Consistent shadcn/ui theming throughout
- **Screenshot mode**: Hides all UI elements and shows all labels for clean screenshots
- **Professional modal dialogs**: Custom-styled edit dialogs with keyboard support

### üíæ Data Management
- **File-based save/load system**: JSON format with drag-and-drop support
- User-customizable filenames with automatic timestamping
- Local timezone timestamps (format: YYYY-MM-DDTHHMMSS)
- Map title persistence in saved files
- Marker grouping data preserved in save files
- Clear confirmation dialog to prevent accidental data loss

### üè∑Ô∏è Labels & Visualization
- Toggle-able labels for all markers
- Custom popup styling with dark background
- Positioned to the right of markers with proper spacing
- Click-to-center functionality for markers in sidebar
- Screenshot mode for clean map exports

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Features
- Icon-specific data persistence (deviceIcon, assetIcon fields)
- Hierarchical marker organization with parent-child relationships
- Event-driven architecture for map interactions
- Optimized for industrial use with clear, professional styling
- Responsive design with fixed sidebar layout

## Development History

### Phase 1: Initial Setup
- Created Docker containerized development environment
- Set up basic Mapbox GL JS integration
- Implemented full-screen map with basic controls

### Phase 2: Core Features
- Added drag-and-drop pin placement system
- Implemented address search functionality
- Created marker type system (Locations, Devices, Assets)
- Added save/clear functionality for markers

### Phase 3: UI/UX Refinement
- Applied shadcn/ui theming for professional appearance
- Reorganized layout with left/right sidebars
- Added zoom display and satellite/street view toggle
- Implemented re-center button with off-center state detection

### Phase 4: Search Enhancement
- Integrated Mapbox Search Box for autocomplete
- Fixed search icon overlapping issues
- Improved address parsing for full location details
- Enhanced search result handling for FeatureCollection responses

### Phase 5: Marker Management
- Added individual marker editing (rename functionality)
- Implemented Material Design icons for edit/delete buttons
- Optimized toolbar width (95px) for proper marker layout
- Added click-to-center functionality for sidebar markers

### Phase 6: Labels & Visualization
- Implemented toggle-able labels for all markers
- Custom popup styling with dark background and right positioning
- Added screenshot mode for clean map exports
- Enhanced visual hierarchy and spacing

### Phase 7: Data Persistence
- Implemented file-based save/load system with JSON format
- Added drag-and-drop file loading support
- User-customizable filenames with automatic timestamping
- Map title persistence and editing functionality

### Phase 8: Advanced Features
- **Hierarchical marker grouping**: Drag markers in sidebar to create parent-child relationships
- Drag-off functionality to remove markers from groups
- Visual hierarchy with left borders for grouped markers
- Multiple device icons (memory, wifi, solar-panel) and asset icons (build, lan, warning, power)
- Icon-specific data persistence and 16px sizing standardization
- Clear confirmation dialog and active state fixes

### Phase 9: Professional Polish
- **Professional edit dialog**: Combined name and GPS coordinate editing in single modal

- ‚úÖ Complete marker placement and management system
- ‚úÖ Hierarchical marker grouping and organization
- ‚úÖ Professional edit dialogs with GPS coordinate editing
- ‚úÖ Marker lock/unlock system for position control
- ‚úÖ File-based save/load with drag-and-drop support
- ‚úÖ Full search and navigation capabilities
- ‚úÖ Professional UI with Material Design elements
- ‚úÖ Screenshot mode for clean exports
- ‚úÖ Multiple marker types with custom icons (including solar panel SVG)
- ‚úÖ Environment-based token management for GitHub Pages
- ‚úÖ Docker development environment
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features

## Key Design Decisions

### Technology Choices
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Chosen for simplicity and direct control
- **Mapbox GL JS**: Selected for robust mapping capabilities and industrial-grade performance
- **Material Design Icons**: Used for intuitive, space-efficient controls
- **shadcn/ui Colors**: Applied for consistent, professional theming

### Architecture Decisions
- **Session-based state**: Prioritized stability over persistence
- **Event-driven design**: Used Mapbox event system for responsive interactions
- **Modular functions**: Organized code for maintainability
- **Fixed sidebar layout**: Optimized for industrial workflow patterns

## Future Considerations
- **Backend Integration**: API integration for data persistence and sharing
- **Advanced Features**: Layer management, measurement tools, additional export formats
- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly interactions for tablet use
- **Additional Marker Types**: Custom marker creation and icon upload
- **Collaborative Features**: Real-time sharing and multi-user editing

## Development Commands
```bash
# Start development server
docker-compose up

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server (inside container)
npm run dev
```

## Notes for Future Development
- The application successfully implements complex features with vanilla JavaScript
- File-based save/load system works well for data persistence without backend
- Hierarchical marker grouping demonstrates advanced UI interactions
- Current Docker setup works well for development consistency
- Mapbox integration is solid and can support additional features
- Icon system is flexible and can accommodate new marker types easily
